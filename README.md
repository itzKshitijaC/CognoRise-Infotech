## Task 2
### Customer Personality Analysis

• Customer Personality Analysis is a detailed analysis of a company’s ideal customers. It helps a business to understand its customers better. It makes it easier for them to modify products according to their specific needs, behaviors and concerns of different types of customers.

• Customer personality analysis helps a business modify its product based on its target customers from different customer segments. For example, instead of spending money to market a new product to every customer in the company’s database, a company can analyze which customer segment is most likely to buy the product and then market the product only on that particular segment.
